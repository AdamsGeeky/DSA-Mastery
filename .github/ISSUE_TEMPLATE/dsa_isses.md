## Issue Template for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

### Language Choice

- **Programming Language:** [Specify the programming language used for your DSA problem]

### Language Details

#### C++
- **Description:** C++ is a powerful language that allows you to work at a lower level than Python or Java. It provides more control over memory management, which is crucial when analyzing space and time complexity. C++'s Standard Template Library (STL) offers a wide range of data structures and algorithms for analysis and optimization.
- **Usage:** [Explain how C++ is used in your DSA problem]

#### Java
- **Description:** Java is still a good choice at this level, as it has well-documented libraries for data structures and algorithms. It's easier to focus on analysis and optimization without worrying about low-level memory management.
- **Usage:** [Explain how Java is used in your DSA problem]

### Problem Description

- **Issue:** [Briefly describe the DSA problem or challenge]
- **Expected Behavior:** [Explain what the expected behavior or solution should be]
- **Current Behavior:** [Describe the current behavior or any issues encountered]
- **Steps to Reproduce:** [Provide steps to reproduce the problem if applicable]

### Additional Context

- **Screenshots or Code Snippets:** [If relevant, provide any code snippets or screenshots]
- **Environment Details:** [Specify any relevant information about the environment or tools used]
- **Related Issues or References:** [Include links to related issues or references]

**Note:** Feel free to customize this template to match the specific requirements of your DSA project or problem. Providing detailed information will help contributors understand and address the issue effectively.
