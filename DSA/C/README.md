# Introduction and Fundamentals

## Essential  

- **Understanding Big O Notation:** This helps in analyzing the efficiency of 
- **Problem-Solving Approaches:** Mastering different algorithmic approaches like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

## Days 1-10:

- Learn the basics of DSA:
  - What are data structures and algorithms?
  - Different types of data structures and algorithms.
  - Time and space complexity.
  - Pseudocode.
- Choose a programming language:
  - Some popular programming languages for DSA include Python, Java, and C++.
  - It is recommended to learn the basics of your chosen programming language before starting with DSA.
- Learn the basics of your chosen programming language:
  - Variables and data types.
  - Operators and expressions.
  - Conditional statements and loops.
  - Functions and modules.

### Days 11-20:

- Learn about arrays:
  - What is an array?
  - How to declare and initialize an array.
  - How to access and modify elements of an array.
  - Common array operations, such as searching and sorting.

### Days 21-30:

- Learn about linked lists:
  - What is a linked list?
  - How to create and manipulate a linked list.
  - Common linked list operations, such as insertion, deletion, and search.

### Days 31-40:

- Learn about stacks and queues:
  - What is a stack?
  - What is a queue?
  - How to implement a stack and queue in your chosen programming language.
  - Common stack and queue operations.

### Days 41-50:

- Learn about trees:
  - What is a tree?
  - Different types of trees, such as binary search trees and heaps.
  - How to implement a tree in your chosen programming language.
  - Common tree operations, such as searching, traversal, and insertion.

### Days 51-60:

- Learn about graphs:
  - What is a graph?
  - Different types of graphs, such as directed and undirected graphs.
  - How to represent a graph in your chosen programming language.
  - Common graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search and depth-first search.

- **projects** Work on a small project where you can implement data structures and algorithms in a practical scenario (e.g., building a simple search engine or a scheduling system).
