# Doubly-Linked-List-Operations

Welcome to the Doubly Linked List Operations repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a simple C program showcasing operations on a doubly linked list. The program allows users to perform various actions, such as inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position, sorting the list, and printing it in both forward and reverse order.

## Features
- **Insertion Operations:** Easily insert nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position in the doubly linked list.
- **Sorting Functionality:** Utilizes the bubble sort algorithm to sort the linked list in ascending order.
- **Print in Both Directions:** View the doubly linked list in both forward and reverse order.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the C program using a C compiler of your choice.

3. Run the compiled executable and interact with the user-friendly menu to perform desired operations on the doubly linked list.

## Code Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the main program with a 

user-friendly menu for interacting with the doubly linked list.

Define the structure of the doubly linked list and implement various operations.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdamsGeeky/DSA-Mastery.git

cd DSA-Mastery/DSA/C/Linkdlist
gcc main.c -o doble_linked_list 
./doubly_linked_list

```
